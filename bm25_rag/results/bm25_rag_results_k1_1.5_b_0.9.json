We intuitively expect that the postamble should encourage models to provide\nmore facts in their responses and to provide more-specific facts rather than general facts.\nTo analyze the effect of t",

As advances in LLMs continue to take place, the\nsoftware engineering community has a responsibility to provide\nknowledge on how to realise robust systems with LLMs. This work\nis an important step for robustness in building RAG systems.\nResearch questions for this work include:\n• What are the failure points that occur when engineering a RAG\nsystem? (section 5) We present an empirical experiment using\nthe BioASQ data set to report on potential failure points. The\nexperi",
